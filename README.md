## 2nd Semester Project: Product Information Management (PIM)
This project is a Product Information Management (PIM) system developed during our 2nd semester.

We collaborated with three other groups to build a complete ecosystem consisting of:
DAM: Digital Asset Management System
OMS: Order Management System
Shop: A frontend integration connecting all systems.

Result: All our group members individually received a grade of 12 (Danish scale).

### N.B
This project was originally hosted on SDU's GitLab in a monorepo shared with the other system groups. Since the university has since deleted the original repository, this GitHub repository contains a fresh push from our local backups. This is why the commit history appears recent.
